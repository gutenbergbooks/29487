<div class="bk1"><p><i><big><b>Of all the irksome, frustrating,
maddening discoveries&mdash;was there
no way of keeping it discovered?</b></big></i></p></div>

<p class="hd1"><big><b>Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS</b></big></p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> so much at stake,
Charles Dennison should
not have been careless.
An inventor cannot afford carelessness,
particularly when his invention
is extremely valuable and
obviously patentable. There are
too many grasping hands ready to
seize what belongs to someone
else, too many men who feast upon
the creativity of the innocent.</p>

<p>A touch of paranoia would have
served Dennison well; but he was
lacking in that vital characteristic
of inventors. And he didn't even
realize the full extent of his carelessness
until a bullet, fired from
a silenced weapon, chipped a
granite wall not three inches from
his head.</p>

<p>Then he knew. But by then it
was too late.</p>

<p>Charles Dennison had been left
a more than adequate income by
his father. He had gone to Harvard,
served a hitch in the Navy,
then continued his education at
M.I.T. Since the age of thirty-two,
he had been engaged in
private research, working in his
own small laboratory in Riverdale,
New York. Plant biology was
his field. He published several
noteworthy papers, and sold a new
insecticide to a development corporation.
The royalties helped him
to expand his facilities.</p>

<p>Dennison enjoyed working
alone. It suited his temperament,
which was austere but not unfriendly.
Two or three times a
year, he would come to New York,
see some plays and movies, and
do a little serious drinking. He
would then return gratefully to his
seclusion. He was a bachelor and
seemed destined to remain that
way.</p>

<p>Not long after his fortieth birthday,
Dennison stumbled across an
intriguing clue which led him into
a different branch of biology. He
pursued his clue, developed it,
extended it slowly into a hypothesis.
After three more years, a
lucky accident put the final proofs
into his hands.</p>

<p>He had invented a most effective
longevity drug. It was not
proof against violence; aside from
that, however, it could fairly be
called an immortality serum.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now</span> was the time for caution.
But years of seclusion had
made Dennison unwary of people
and their motives. He was more or
less heedless of the world around
him; it never occurred to him that
the world was not equally heedless
of him.</p>

<p>He thought only about his
serum. It was valuable and patentable.
But was it the sort of thing
that should be revealed? Was the
world ready for an immortality
drug?</p>

<p>He had never enjoyed speculation
of this sort. But since the
atom bomb, many scientists had
been forced to look at the ethics
of their profession. Dennison
looked at his and decided that
immortality was inevitable.</p>

<p>Mankind had, throughout its
existence, poked and probed into
the recesses of nature, trying to
figure out how things worked. If
one man didn't discover fire, or
the use of the lever, or gunpowder,
or the atom bomb, or immortality,
another would. Man willed to
know all nature's secrets, and there
was no way of keeping them
hidden.</p>

<p>Armed with this bleak but
comforting philosophy, Dennison
packed his formulas and proofs
into a briefcase, slipped a two-ounce
bottle of the product into a
jacket pocket, and left his Riverdale
laboratory. It was already
evening. He planned to spend the
night in a good midtown hotel,
see a movie, and proceed to the
Patent Office in Washington the
following day.</p>

<p>On the subway, Dennison was
absorbed in a newspaper. He was
barely conscious of the men sitting
on either side of him. He became
aware of them only when the man
on his right poked him firmly in
the ribs.</p>

<p>Dennison glanced over and saw
the snub nose of a small automatic,
concealed from the rest of
the car by a newspaper, resting
against his side.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Dennison asked.</p>

<p>"Hand it over," the man said.</p>

<p>Dennison was stunned. How
could anyone have known about
his discovery? And how could they
dare try to rob him in a public
subway car?</p>

<p>Then he realized that they were
probably just after his money.</p>

<p>"I don't have much on me,"
Dennison said hoarsely, reaching
for his wallet.</p>

<p>The man on his left leaned over
and slapped the briefcase. "Not
money," he said. "The immortality
stuff."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> some unaccountable fashion,
they knew. What if he refused
to give up his briefcase? Would
they dare fire the automatic in
the subway? It was a very small
caliber weapon. Its noise might
not even be heard above the subway's
roar. And probably they felt
justified in taking the risk for a
prize as great as the one Dennison
carried.</p>

<p>He looked at them quickly.
They were mild-looking men,
quietly, almost somberly dressed.
Something about their clothing
jogged Dennison's memory unpleasantly,
but he didn't have time
to place the recollection. The automatic
was digging painfully into
his ribs.</p>

<p>The subway was coming to a
station. Dennison glanced at the
man on his left and caught the
glint of light on a tiny hypodermic.</p>

<p>Many inventors, involved only
in their own thoughts, are slow
of reaction. But Dennison had
been a gunnery officer in the Navy
and had seen his share of action.
He was damned if he was going to
give up his invention so easily.</p>

<p>He jumped from his seat and
the hypo passed through the sleeve
of his coat, just missing his arm.
He swung the briefcase at the
man with the automatic, catching
him across the forehead with the
metal edge. As the doors opened,
he ran past a popeyed subway
guard, up the stairs and into the
street.</p>

<p>The two men followed, one of
them streaming blood from his
forehead. Dennison ran, looking
wildly around for a policeman.</p>

<p>The men behind him were
screaming, "Stop, thief! Police!
Police! Stop that man!"</p>

<p>Apparently they were also prepared
to face the police and to
claim the briefcase and bottle as
their own. Ridiculous! Yet the
complete and indignant confidence
in their shrill voices unnerved
Dennison. He hated a scene.</p>

<p>Still, a policeman would be best.
The briefcase was filled with proof
of who he was. Even his name was
initialed on the outside of the briefcase.
One glance would tell anyone ...</p>

<p>He caught a flash of metal from
his briefcase, and, still running,
looked at it. He was shocked to
see a metal plate fixed to the cowhide,
over the place where his
initials had been. The man on his
left must have done that when he
slapped the briefcase.</p>

<p>Dennison dug at the plate with
his fingertips, but it would not
come off.</p>

<p>It read, <i>Property of Edward
James Flaherty, Smithfield Institute</i>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a policeman wouldn't
be so much help, after all.</p>

<p>But the problem was academic,
for Dennison saw no policeman
along the crowded Bronx street.
People stood aside as he ran past,
staring open-mouthed, offering
neither assistance nor interference.
But the men behind him were
still screaming, "Stop the thief!
Stop the thief!"</p>

<p>The entire long block was
alerted. The people, like some
sluggish beast goaded reluctantly
into action, began to make tentative
movements toward Dennison,
impelled by the outraged cries of
his pursuers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Unless</span> he balanced the scales
of public opinion, some do-gooder
was going to interfere
soon. Dennison conquered his shyness
and pride, and called out,
"Help me! They're trying to rob
me! Stop them!"</p>

<p>But his voice lacked the moral
indignation, the absolute conviction
of his two shrill-voiced pursuers.
A burly young man stepped
forward to block Dennison's way,
but at the last moment a woman
pulled him back.</p>

<p>"Don't get into trouble, Charley."</p>

<p>"Why don't someone call a
cop?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, where are the cops?"</p>

<p>"Over at a big fire on 178th
Street, I hear."</p>

<p>"We oughta stop that guy."</p>

<p>"I'm willing if you're willing."</p>

<p>Dennison's way was suddenly
blocked by four grinning youths,
teen-agers in black motorcycle
jackets and boots, excited by the
chance for a little action, delighted
at the opportunity to hit someone
in the name of law and order.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="372" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Dennison saw them, swerved
suddenly and sprinted across the
street. A bus loomed in front of
him.</p>

<p>He hurled himself out of its
way, fell, got up again and ran on.</p>

<p>His pursuers were delayed by
the dense flow of traffic. Their
high-pitched cries faded as Dennison
turned into a side street, ran
down its length, then down another.</p>

<p>He was in a section of massive
apartment buildings. His lungs felt
like a blast furnace and his left
side seemed to be sewed together
with red-hot wire. There was no
help for it, he had to rest.</p>

<p>It was then that the first bullet,
fired from a silenced weapon,
chipped a granite wall not three
inches from his head. That was
when Dennison realized the full
extent of his carelessness.</p>

<p>He pulled the bottle out of his
pocket. He had hoped to carry out
more experiments on the serum
before trying it on human beings.
Now there was no choice.</p>

<p>Dennison yanked out the stopper
and drained the contents.</p>

<p>Immediately he was running
again, as a second bullet scored
the granite wall. The great blocks
of apartments loomed endlessly
ahead of him, silent and alien.
There were no walkers upon the
streets. There was only Dennison,
running more slowly now past the
immense, blank-faced apartments.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;long</span> black car came up
behind him, its searchlight
probing into doors and alleys. Was
it the police?</p>

<p>"That's him!" cried the shrill,
unnerving voice of one of Dennison's
pursuers.</p>

<p>Dennison ducked into a narrow
alley between buildings, raced
down it and into the next street.</p>

<p>There were two cars on that
street, at either end of the block,
their headlights shining toward
each other, moving slowly to trap
him in the middle. The alley
gleamed with light now, from the
first car's headlights shining down
it. He was surrounded.</p>

<p>Dennison raced to the nearest
apartment building and yanked at
the door. It was locked. The two
cars were almost even with him.
And, looking at them, Dennison remembered
the unpleasant jog his
memory had given him earlier.</p>

<p>The two cars were hearses.</p>

<p>The men in the subway, with
their solemn faces, solemn clothing,
subdued neckties, shrill, indignant
voices&mdash;they had reminded
him of undertakers. They
<i>had</i> been undertakers!</p>

<p>Of course! Of course! Oil companies
might want to block the invention
of a cheap new fuel which
could put them out of business;
steel corporations might try to
stop the development of an
inexpensive, stronger-than-steel
plastic ...</p>

<p>And the production of an immortality
serum would put the undertakers
out of business.</p>

<p>His progress, and the progress
of thousands of other researchers
in biology, must have been
watched. And when he made his
discovery, they had been ready.</p>

<p>The hearses stopped, and somber-faced,
respectable-looking men
in black suits and pearl-gray neckties
poured out and seized him.
The briefcase was yanked out of
his hand. He felt the prick of a
needle in his shoulder. Then, with
no transitional dizziness, he passed
out.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> came to sitting in an armchair.
There were armed men
on either side of him. In front of
him stood a small, plump, undistinguished-looking
man in sedate
clothing.</p>

<p>"My name is Mr. Bennet," the
plump man said. "I wish to beg
your forgiveness, Mr. Dennison,
for the violence to which you were
subjected. We found out about
your invention only at the last
moment and therefore had to improvise.
The bullets were meant
only to frighten and delay you.
Murder was not our intention."</p>

<p>"You merely wanted to steal
my discovery," Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Mr. Bennet told
him. "The secret of immortality
has been in our possession for
quite some time."</p>

<p>"I see. Then you want to keep
immortality from the public in
order to safeguard your damned
undertaking business!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather a naive view?"
Mr. Bennet asked, smiling. "As it
happens, my associates and I are
<i>not</i> undertakers. We took on the
disguise in order to present an understandable
motive if our plan to
capture you had misfired. In that
event, others would have believed
exactly&mdash;and only&mdash;what you
thought: that our purpose was to
safeguard our business."</p>

<p>Dennison frowned and watchfully
waited.</p>

<p>"Disguises come easily to us,"
Mr. Bennet said, still smiling. "Perhaps
you have heard rumors about
a new carburetor suppressed by
the gasoline companies, or a new
food source concealed by the great
food suppliers, or a new synthetic
hastily destroyed by the cotton-owning
interests. That was us.
And the inventions ended up here."</p>

<p>"You're trying to impress me,"
Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Why did you stop me from
patenting my immortality serum?"</p>

<p>"The world is not ready for it
yet," said Mr. Bennet.</p>

<p>"It isn't ready for a lot of
things," Dennison said. "Why
didn't you block the atom bomb?"</p>

<p>"We tried, disguised as mercenary
coal and oil interests. But
we failed. However, we have succeeded
with a surprising number
of things."</p>

<p>"But what's the purpose behind
it all?"</p>

<p>"Earth's welfare," Mr. Bennet
said promptly. "Consider what
would happen if the people were
given your veritable immortality
serum. The problems of birth rate,
food production, living space all
would be aggravated. Tensions
would mount, war would be imminent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So what?" Dennison challenged.
"That's how things are
right now, <i>without</i> immortality.
Besides, there have been cries of
doom about every new invention
or discovery. Gunpowder, the
printing press, nitroglycerin, the
atom bomb, they were all supposed
to destroy the race. But
mankind has learned how to
handle them. It had to! You can't
turn back the clock, and you can't
un-discover something. If it's there,
mankind must deal with it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a bumbling, bloody, inefficient
fashion," said Mr. Bennet,
with an expression of distaste.</p>

<p>"Well, that's how Man is."</p>

<p>"Not if he's properly led," Mr.
Bennet said.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Certainly</span> not," said Mr.
Bennet. "You see, the immortality
serum provides a solution
to the problem of political
power. Rule by a permanent and
enlightened elite is by far the best
form of government; infinitely better
than the blundering inefficiencies
of democratic rule. But
throughout history, this elite,
whether monarchy, oligarchy, dictatorship
or junta, has been unable
to perpetuate itself. Leaders
die, the followers squabble for
power, and chaos is close behind.
With immortality, this last flaw
would be corrected. There would
be no discontinuity of leadership,
for the leaders would always be
there."</p>

<p>"A permanent dictatorship,"
Dennison said.</p>

<p>"Yes. A permanent, benevolent
rule by small, carefully chosen
elite corps, based upon the sole
and exclusive possession of immortality.
It's historically inevitable.
The only question is, who is
going to get control first?"</p>

<p>"And you think you are?" Dennison
demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course. Our organization is
still small, but absolutely solid. It
is bolstered by every new invention
that comes into our hands and
by every scientist who joins our
ranks. Our time will come, Dennison!
We'd like to have you with
us, among the elite."</p>

<p>"You want <i>me</i> to join you?"
Dennison asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"We do. Our organization needs
creative scientific minds to help us
in our work, to help us save mankind
from itself."</p>

<p>"Count me out," Dennison said,
his heart beating fast.</p>

<p>"You won't join us?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you all hanged."</p>

<p>Mr. Bennet nodded thoughtfully
and pursed his small lips. "You
have taken your own serum, have
you not?"</p>

<p>Dennison nodded. "I suppose
that means you kill me now?"</p>

<p>"We don't kill," Mr. Bennet
said. "We merely wait. I think you
are a reasonable man, and I think
you'll come to see things our way.
We'll be around a long time. So
will you. Take him away."</p>

<p>Dennison was led to an elevator
that dropped deep into the Earth.
He was marched down a long passageway
lined with armed men.
They went through four massive
doors. At the fifth, Dennison was
pushed inside alone, and the door
was locked behind him.</p>

<p>He was in a large, well-furnished
apartment. There were perhaps
twenty people in the room,
and they came forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>One of them, a stocky, bearded
man, was an old college acquaintance
of Dennison's.</p>

<p>"Jim Ferris?"</p>

<p>"That's right," Ferris said. "Welcome
to the Immortality Club,
Dennison."</p>

<p>"I read you were killed in an
air crash last year."</p>

<p>"I merely&mdash;disappeared," Ferris
said, with a rueful smile, "after inventing
the immortality serum.
Just like the others."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen of the men here invented
the serum independently.
The rest are successful inventors
in other fields. Our oldest member
is Doctor Li, a serum discoverer,
who disappeared from San
Francisco in 1911. You are our
latest acquisition. Our clubhouse
is probably the most carefully
guarded place on Earth."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dennison</span> said, "Nineteen-eleven!"
Despair flooded him
and he sat down heavily in a
chair. "Then there's no possibility
of rescue?"</p>

<p>"None. There are only four
choices available to us," Ferris
said. "Some have left us and joined
the Undertakers. Others have suicided.
A few have gone insane.
The rest of us have formed the
Immortality Club."</p>

<p>"What for?" Dennison bewilderedly
asked.</p>

<p>"To get out of this place!" said
Ferris. "To escape and give our
discoveries to the world. To stop
those hopeful little dictators upstairs."</p>

<p>"They must know what you're
planning."</p>

<p>"Of course. But they let us live
because, every so often, one of us
gives up and joins them. And they
don't think we can ever break
out. They're much too smug. It's
the basic defect of all power-elites,
and their eventual undoing."</p>

<p>"You said this was the most
closely guarded place on Earth?"</p>

<p>"It is," Ferris said.</p>

<p>"And some of you have been
trying to break out for fifty years?
Why, it'll take forever to escape!"</p>

<p>"Forever is exactly how long
we have," said Ferris. "But we
hope it won't take quite that long.
Every new man brings new ideas,
plans. One of them is bound to
work."</p>

<p>"<i>Forever</i>," Dennison said, his
face buried in his hands.</p>

<p>"You can go back upstairs and
join them," Ferris said, with a
hard note to his voice, "or you can
suicide, or just sit in a corner and
go quietly mad. Take your pick."</p>

<p>Dennison looked up. "I must be
honest with you and with myself.
I don't think we can escape. Furthermore,
I don't think any of you
really believe we can."</p>

<p>Ferris shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Aside from that," Dennison
said, "I think it's a damned good
idea. If you'll bring me up to date,
I'll contribute whatever I can to
the Forever Project. And let's
hope their complacency lasts."</p>

<p>"It will," Ferris said.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> escape did not take forever,
of course. In one hundred
and thirty-seven years, Dennison
and his colleagues made their successful
breakout and revealed the
Undertakers' Plot. The Undertakers
were tried before the High
Court on charges of kidnapping,
conspiracy to overthrow the government,
and illegal possession of
immortality. They were found
guilty on all counts and summarily
executed.</p>

<p>Dennison and his colleagues
were also in illegal possession of
immortality, which is the privilege
only of our governmental elite.
But the death penalty was waived
in view of the Immortality Club's
service to the State.</p>

<p>This mercy was premature,
however. After some months the
members of the Immortality Club
went into hiding, with the avowed
purpose of overthrowing the Elite
Rule and disseminating immortality
among the masses. Project
Forever, as they termed it, has
received some support from dissidents,
who have not yet been apprehended.
It cannot be considered
a serious threat.</p>

<p>But this deviationist action in
no way detracts from the glory of
the Club's escape from the Undertakers.
The ingenious way in which
Dennison and his colleagues broke
out of their seemingly impregnable
prison, using only a steel belt
buckle, a tungsten filament, three
hens' eggs, and twelve chemicals
that can be readily obtained from
the human body, is too well known
to be repeated here.</p>
